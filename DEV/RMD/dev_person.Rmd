# Patient table
I think the way to do this is to create a few intermediate tables.
- patkey_zip
- patkey_gender
- patkey_birthyear 
- patkey_pcp (with pcp location)

These fields will be derived from the medical eligibility table. First we will calculate approximate birthyear for each eligibility record. Then we will take the most frequently occuring non-missing value for zipcode, gender, and birthyear.
Only patients with valid values for all of these variables will be kept.

patkey_pcp has patkey, pcp_npi, pcp_practice_location (might be multiple values)

```{sql connection = con}

  FROM (
    -- count up records grouped by patkey and pat_zip
    SELECT patkey, pat_zip, 
    CASE WHEN ((pat_zip IS NULL) OR pat_zip = '') THEN 0 
         ELSE (COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY patkey, pat_zip)) END AS record_count
